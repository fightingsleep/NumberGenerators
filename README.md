# NumberGenerators

This repository contains the following classes for generating numbers:

- #### ProbabilisticNumberGenerator
    - This class takes a set of permissible values, and a probability distribution representing how often those values should occur. When calling the generator repeatedly, the values will be returned with a frequency corresponding to their given probabilities.
